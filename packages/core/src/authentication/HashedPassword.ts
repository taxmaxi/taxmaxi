/**
 * HashedPassword - Branded type for securely hashed passwords
 *
 * Represents a password that has been cryptographically hashed using
 * a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, argon2). The branding ensures
 * that plain text passwords cannot be accidentally used where a
 * hashed password is expected.
 *
 * The hash string format depends on the algorithm used:
 * - bcrypt: $2a$10$... or $2b$10$... (60 characters)
 * - argon2: $argon2id$v=19$... (variable length)
