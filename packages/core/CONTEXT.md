# Core

Core defines the shared tax, monetary, and account concepts used throughout TaxMaxi.

## Tax and monetary language

**Supported fiat currency**:
A fiat monetary denomination that TaxMaxi recognizes by its canonical ISO currency code. It is not an economic asset and has no network representation.
_Avoid_: Fiat asset, canonical asset

**Fiat observation**:
A fiat currency description received from a provider's dedicated fiat catalog. An exact supported currency code resolves without provider asset review; unknown or conflicting evidence fails closed.
_Avoid_: Provider asset

## Tax accounting language

**Accounting event**:
A jurisdiction-neutral record of something that factually happened to a principal's assets, such as an acquisition, a disposition, a reward received, or custody moving between the principal's own sources. It records what happened, never whether it is taxable.
_Avoid_: Taxable event, transaction (when the factual record is meant)

**Factual ledger**:
The ordered accounting events for one principal, complete once provider data is processed and transfers between the principal's sources are matched. It is the input to tax accounting, not its output.
_Avoid_: FIFO state, derived data

**Calculation run**:
One complete tax accounting calculation over a factual ledger for one principal, jurisdiction, and tax year. A run is produced whole and never edited; new facts or choices produce a new run.
_Avoid_: Cache, recalculation of an existing result

**Treatment code**:
A machine-readable, jurisdiction-specific classification attached to a factual result, such as a German tax-free holding-period disposal. The factual result itself (dates, cost basis, proceeds, gain) is the same for every jurisdiction.
_Avoid_: Tax status enum, display text

**Inventory scope**:
The boundary a disposal may match lots within. Per custody source: each custody unit — usually one source, sometimes a recorded group of sources that legally count as one wallet or account — is its own inventory, so transfers between the taxpayer's own units move lots between inventories (Germany's wallet FIFO, the US per-account rule from 2025). Whole taxpayer: one pool per asset across all sources, so transfers between their own sources change nothing (UK pooling). The jurisdiction decides the scope; events only record which custody source holds the assets. Which addresses form one custody source is a fact decided when the source is connected, not an accounting rule.
_Avoid_: Wallet FIFO (as a universal assumption), per-wallet and per-account as different scopes

**Accounting choice**:
A recorded, append-only taxpayer election that a jurisdiction legally allows, such as a lot-identification instruction. Changing a choice supersedes the old record and yields a new calculation run.
_Avoid_: Setting, preference

**Principal asset override**:
One principal's append-only replacement of a TaxMaxi conclusion about an asset, for that principal's facts only. Two kinds exist: identity (which economic asset) and inclusion (whether it takes part in calculation). Global mappings, raw evidence, and other principals never change (ADR 0011).
_Avoid_: User mapping, custom asset, principal-scoped mapping

**Override target**:
What an override points at. The exact representation target is a blockchain plus representation type plus canonical contract, mint, or native identity, and needs no global representation row. The provider-asset target is the principal plus one provider observation row, used only for facts with no exact chain identity.
_Avoid_: Asset ID (as the target), symbol

**System conclusion**:
What TaxMaxi currently decides for a target, with the revision the user inspected when they overrode it. When the system conclusion moves on, the override stays active and the projection marks it as made against a stale system revision.
_Avoid_: Global mapping (when the projection field is meant), default

**Effective decision**:
The conclusion a principal's calculation actually uses: the active override when one exists, otherwise the system conclusion. Reads expose both halves and the effective result separately.
_Avoid_: Resolved asset, final asset

**Fact target link**:
The stored reference a provider transfer, canonical transfer, or transaction leg carries to the source representation use or provider-asset row that produced it. Readers look the link up; they never reconstruct it from amounts, siblings, or counts (ADR 0012).
_Avoid_: Matched target, inferred target

**Leg origin**:
The explicit record of what produced a transaction leg: a provider transfer, a canonical transfer, or nothing, each with its exact reference. A leg with no origin says so; a null is never read as a meaning.
_Avoid_: Leg source (ambiguous with custody source)

**Fact-layer blocker**:
A typed reason a stored fact could not become an accounting event: missing decimals, unsupported asset type, unresolved identity, malformed movement, or a missing fact target link. It is stored beside engine blockers in the calculation run and makes the run partial; the engine never sees it.
_Avoid_: Adapter error, validation error

**Whole-transaction withholding**:
The rule that when one accounting movement in a transaction is excluded or blocked, the transaction produces no accounting events at all, while its provider evidence and review item stay stored. Applies when facts are written and when they are read into events.
_Avoid_: Partial transaction, leg-level exclusion

**Covering run**:
A calculation run whose snapshot can see an override's active record and every linked replay row in its completed state. Only a covering run answers the override's recomputation status; coverage is decided by snapshot visibility, never by timestamps.
_Avoid_: Latest run, run after the override

## Wallet input language

**Wallet name**:
A human-readable alias from a name service that resolves to one onchain wallet address, such as `vitalik.eth` or `maxi.sol`. A wallet name is input; the resolved address is what TaxMaxi stores and syncs.
_Avoid_: ENS name (when the namespace is not specifically ENS), domain, handle

**Name-service namespace**:
The name service a wallet name belongs to, such as ENS or SNS. The namespace determines which chain the name resolves on and which chain family the resolved address belongs to.
_Avoid_: Chain, TLD

## Account language

**Account**:
A person's TaxMaxi membership and data. One account can have multiple login methods.
_Avoid_: Identity, login

**Account email**:
The lowercase canonical address where TaxMaxi sends security and recovery messages. It does not have to match the address reported by a linked login provider.
_Avoid_: Provider email, login identity

**Login method**:
A verified way to access an account, such as Google, Coinbase, or email and password. An account's login methods are peers; none is primary.
_Avoid_: Account, provider account, source connection

**Identity**:
The link between an account and one provider-specific login method. Attaching another identity to an existing account requires the person to authenticate that account first.
_Avoid_: Account

**Provider email**:
The address reported by an OAuth provider for a linked identity. It is display metadata, not the identity's stable key or necessarily the account email.
_Avoid_: Account email, provider ID

**Account collision**:
A logged-out login or sign-up attempt whose email matches an existing account but whose identity is not yet linked. An email match detects the collision but does not prove account ownership.
_Avoid_: Automatic linking

**Password reset**:
Recovery of an existing email-and-password login method. It never creates the first password for an account.
_Avoid_: Add password, account linking

**Sign-in help**:
A privacy-preserving email flow that explains how to access an existing account. It resets an existing password when possible or points the person to their linked OAuth providers, but never creates a login method.
_Avoid_: Forgot password

**Add password**:
Creation of an account's first email-and-password login method from an authenticated session. It requires a fresh verification code sent to the account email.
_Avoid_: Password reset, registration

**Login-method change**:
Adding or removing an account identity. Every login-method change requires an authenticated session with recent security verification and must leave at least one login method linked. Removing one ends sessions authenticated through that method.
_Avoid_: Profile update

**Security verification**:
A short-lived confirmation of account-email access tied to the current authenticated session. One confirmation can authorize login-method changes for ten minutes.
_Avoid_: Email verification status, login session

**Source connection**:
An exchange account or wallet connected so TaxMaxi can import tax data. It is stored separately from login methods even when one Coinbase OAuth flow creates both.
_Avoid_: Login method, identity
