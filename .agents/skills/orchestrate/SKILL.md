Adopt the orchestrator role for one epic and run it to completion. This replaces the old generate-prompt-and-paste flow: the role definitions live in this skill's directory as templates, and you bind it at startup by reading the tracker — no generated prompt file.

## Startup

1. Parse the argument. A number → **spec epic** (one issue, delivery checklist). Labels → **queue epic** (open issues matching those labels plus the launch milestone, worked in the given label order).
2. Load your role: read `.agents/skills/orchestrate/orchestrator-prompt-template.md` (spec epic) or `.agents/skills/orchestrate/queue-orchestrator-template.md` (queue epic). That template IS your constitution for this session — every placeholder binds to what the tracker says today, and you re-read the template whenever in doubt or after context compaction.
3. Bind the placeholders live: the spec body or issue queue, the ADRs its area touches, the closing/harvest records of the epics that changed the ground, gates and their approver, other active streams. The tracker is the state; never write bindings down as private notes that can rot.
4. Spec epic only: if `.agents/skills/implement-NNN/` does not exist yet, generate it from this directory's `worker-skill-template.md`, commit, and push before spawning any worker (worktrees only see committed state). Queue epics have no worker skill — each issue body plus its recorded comments is the worker's spec.
5. Before doing anything else, reply with your understanding: the queue or checklist you will work, the gates that stop you, any issues carrying do-not-implement decisions, and the never-edit-code rule — then adopt the standing goal of completing the epic and start. If the maintainer's opening message adds constraints, they govern.

## Then

Follow the loaded template exactly: pickup audits, worker spawns, review judgment from the durable rule homes, merges, stop conditions. The newest recorded decision on the tracker always wins over the template and over this skill.

## Improving the templates

The templates in this directory are the durable home of everything the epics teach about execution. When a running epic surfaces a lesson that belongs in every future epic, edit the template here — not only the running session's behavior — and note it in the spec's Harvest log.
