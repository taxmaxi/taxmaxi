# TaxMaxi

**The open source crypto tax API.**

TaxMaxi helps products calculate crypto taxes from exchange and onchain activity. Use it to import crypto activity, classify taxable events, apply local tax rules, and return tax results from an API or terminal.

It is built for products that need crypto tax support inside their own apps: wallets, exchanges, portfolio trackers, trading bots, accounting tools, fintech apps, and AI agents.

## What you can do with it

- **Add tax calculations** to wallets, exchanges, brokers, portfolio trackers, and accounting products.
- **Calculate taxes from the terminal** with the installable `tax` CLI.
- **Sync activity** from supported exchanges and chains instead of wrangling CSV files.
- **Classify crypto events** such as trades, transfers, rewards, and disposals.
- **Create tax reports** with activity, tax lots, gains, and summaries.

## Why it exists

Most crypto tax tools are apps for individual users. Their assumptions are hard to inspect, their reports are difficult to reuse, and they do not fit products that need crypto tax support inside the product itself.

TaxMaxi makes crypto tax calculation available through a REST API and a CLI. The code is open source so the rules and calculations can be inspected.

## API

The hosted API is available at:

```text
https://api.taxmaxi.com
```

The OpenAPI specification is available at:

```text
https://api.taxmaxi.com/openapi.json
```

## CLI

Install the CLI from npm:

```bash
npm install -g tax
```

Calculate taxes for a wallet address:

```bash
tax <your wallet address>
```

Calculate taxes for your Coinbase account:

```bash
tax coinbase
```

Or run the steps separately:

```bash
tax coinbase connect
tax coinbase sync
tax coinbase calculate --year 2025
```
